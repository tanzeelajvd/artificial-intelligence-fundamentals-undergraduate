You’ve got escaped Markdown characters in there (`\#`, `\*\*`, `\-`) — probably pasted from a renderer or copied in “literal” mode. Below is the **clean, correct Markdown**, ready to paste directly into `README.md`.

Nothing else changed. Just cleaned and readable.

# Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals (Undergraduate)

This repository contains **complete undergraduate-level study material** for Artificial Intelligence, covering both **theoretical foundations** and **hands-on practical implementations**.

It is structured around two academic courses:

* **Artificial Intelligence (Theory)**
* **Artificial Intelligence Lab (Implementation)**

The goal of this repository is to provide a **clean, structured, and practical learning path** for understanding Artificial Intelligence from first principles through implementation.

---

## 📘 Courses Included

### Artificial Intelligence (Theory)

Focuses on the **conceptual and mathematical foundations of AI**, including problem solving, knowledge representation, reasoning under uncertainty, fuzzy logic, machine learning basics, and NLP.

📂 Location: `ai-fundamental-theory/`

---

### Artificial Intelligence Laboratory

Focuses on **implementing AI concepts** using Prolog and Python, including classical AI problems, search algorithms, and introductory machine learning workflows.

📂 Location: `ai-implementations-lab/`

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repository intentionally emphasizes:

* Symbolic AI before statistical AI
* Problem formulation before model training
* Reasoning and search before deep learning

This mirrors how Artificial Intelligence evolved historically and builds strong intuition.

---

## 🎓 Intended Audience

* Undergraduate AI / CS students
* Self-learners studying AI fundamentals
* Educators looking for structured lab material
* Developers revisiting classical AI concepts

---

## 📜 License

This repository is released for **educational and academic use** under an open-source license.
